/**
 * Indicates this object is a proxy for an underlying object which can be changed.
 * 
 * Usually the swap object will implement the same interface as the proxied object (ie an 
 * Swap<List<E>> would implement List<E> and, in all likelihood, delegate most calls to an 
 * underlying list.
 * 
 * While this interface does not have any methods to perform notification about changes it is 
 * assumed that if the proxied object has eventing/listeners events will "pass through" the
 * indirect layer. That is if a listener is added to the swap object and the underlying object
 * fires an event the listener would receive an event. Additionally it is expected that if the 
 * underlying object was changed the listeners would receive an appropriate event.
