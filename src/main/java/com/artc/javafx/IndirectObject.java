 * Indicates this object is a proxy for an underlying object which can be changed.

 * Usually the indirect object will implement the same interface as the proxied object (ie an 
 * IndirectObject<List<E>> would implement List<E> and, in all likelihood, delegate most calls to an 
 * underlying list).
 * 
 * While this interface does not have any method to perform notification about changes it is 
 * assumed that if the proxied object has eventing/listeners the listeners will be added to the
 * underlying object. And if the underlying object was changed the listeners would be switched
 * to the new object (and an appropriate event would be fired indicating that change).
