This is a repo where I'll be adding code related to posts on my blog "Any Relation to Code Living or Dead" (http://kristiankime.blogspot.com/).

The repo should be a working eclipse project as soon as the "gradle eclipse" command is run (assuming you have gradle configured) though, as a heads up, the project requires java 7.

As of 2012-May-22 This code is still a work in progress and should not taken as anything other then an illustration of how one might implement an indirect presentation model support library.
